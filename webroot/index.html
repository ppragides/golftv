        <h1>Congratulations!</h1>
        <h2>You've successfully set up GolfTV</h2>

        <p>If you've gotten this far, that means that you were able to set up your environment such that you're able to
           serve out the TVML required for our tvOS application. 
        </p>

        <h1>Now what?</h1>
        <p>All you'll need to do is to create a new tvOS project, and set your application's tvBaseURL to your local minikube instance.</p>
        <p>If you've followed all of the instructions in the README.md file, it should look something like this:</p>

        <p><i>static let tvBaseURL = "http://local.golf.tv:30080/"</i></p>
